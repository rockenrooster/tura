# GUI Settings

The GUI presents several kinds of settings, but it does not own their persistence.
This page maps each control to the place that actually persists it.

The GUI only submits settings through Gateway APIs. Gateway selects every
durable path and performs all settings-file reads, writes, and migrations.

## Configuration file locations

| Setting group | Configuration location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace runtime settings | `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | Written through the gateway `/session/config` endpoint for the selected workspace directory. |
| GUI appearance settings | Gateway-owned `<TURA_HOME>/.tura/gateway-config.json` | Written through `/config`; stores theme, corner radius, font, font size, and skill-folder settings. |
| Model-tier routes | Gateway-owned provider config; release materializes `<TURA_HOME>/.tura/provider_config.json` from the bundled catalog | Written through `/model_config`; explicit `TURA_PROVIDER_CONFIG` remains available for development and tests. |
| Provider credentials | `.env` resolved from `TURA_ENV_PATH`, or the runtime project root `.env` | API keys and OAuth tokens are stored as provider environment variables. |
| Custom agents | Gateway-selected agent config root; release defaults to `<TURA_HOME>/.tura/agents/src/<agent-id>/` | Written through `/agent` endpoints. Source builds retain `<project-root>/agents/src`; static/default agents cannot be deleted. |

## Application settings

| Setting | Stored key | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Language | `language` in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | GUI language options from the app language catalog, including `en` and `zh-CN` | Changes the GUI language immediately and persists the workspace language for later sessions. |

## Appearance settings

| Setting | Stored key | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Theme color | `theme` in gateway `/config` | `light`, `dark`, `caral`, `uruk`, `liangzhu` | Changes the GUI color theme. |
| Corner radius | `corner_radius` in gateway `/config` | `0px`, `2px`, `8px`, `9.6px` | Changes the radius scale used by GUI surfaces and controls. |
| Main font | `main_font` in gateway `/config` | System, Arial, Noto Sans, humanist, or serif font stack | Sets the primary UI font family. |
| Code font | `code_font` in gateway `/config` | System Mono, Cascadia Code, JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Consolas | Sets the monospace font family used for code and terminal-like content. |
| Main font size | `main_font_size` in gateway `/config` | Integer size from the GUI size picker | Sets the base UI font size. |
| Code font size | `code_font_size` in gateway `/config` | Integer size from the GUI size picker | Sets the code/monospace font size. |

## Runtime model settings

| Setting | Stored key | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Selected model | `model`, with derived `active_provider` and `active_model` in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | Any selected `provider/model` pair | Selects the model used for workspace prompt execution. |
| Active agent | `active_agent` in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | Any discovered agent id | Selects the default agent used for workspace prompt execution. |
| Reasoning effort | `model_variant` in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | Sets the model reasoning-effort variant for workspace prompts. `max` is sent only to GPT-5.6 models and maps to `xhigh` for older models. |
| Priority routing | `model_acceleration_enabled` in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | `true`, `false` | Enables priority/accelerated routing where the selected provider supports it. |

## Model tier settings

| Setting | Stored location | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Thinking tier | Provider config `routes.thinking.providers[0]` | Any listed model option for the `thinking` tier | Sets the first-choice provider/model for the thinking tier. The GUI also updates the workspace `model` selection to the chosen concrete model. |
| Fast tier | Provider config `routes.fast.providers[0]` | Any listed model option for the `fast` tier | Sets the first-choice provider/model for the fast tier. The GUI also updates the workspace `model` selection to the chosen concrete model. |
| Other configured tiers | Provider config `routes.<tier>.providers[0]` | Any listed model option for that tier | If the provider config exposes additional tiers, the GUI shows and edits them the same way. |

## Provider settings

| Setting/action | Stored location | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Provider domain filter | Not persisted | Filters the provider list by domain, such as `llm`, `media_generation`, `search`, or `other`. |
| Provider search | In-memory GUI state | Filters the provider list by text while the GUI is open. |
| API key/token | `.env` resolved from `TURA_ENV_PATH`, or runtime project root `.env` | Stores the key under the provider method's `token_env`, validates it, and updates provider status. |
| OAuth login | `.env` and provider auth metadata in the provider auth flow | Starts OAuth login and stores resulting credentials when the flow completes. Auto flows poll until authenticated; manual/device flows require a code or provider-specific callback step. |
| Validate provider | No new setting unless a draft key is supplied | Checks stored or drafted credentials and displays a validation receipt. |
| Logout provider | Provider auth storage for that provider | Removes stored provider auth and refreshes the provider status. |

## Agent settings

| Setting | Stored location | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Agent provider | Gateway-selected `<agent-id>/agent_config.json`, inside the agent `provider` config | Any provider from the model config options | Sets the provider used by that custom agent. |
| Agent model | Gateway-selected `<agent-id>/agent_config.json`, inside the agent `provider` config | Any model available for the selected provider | Sets the model override used by that custom agent. If unset, the agent falls back to its default model tier. |
| Agent default model tier | Gateway-selected `<agent-id>/agent_config.json`, inside the agent `provider` config | `thinking`, `fast` | Selects which model tier the agent uses when it has no concrete model override. |
| Agent reasoning effort | Gateway-selected `<agent-id>/agent_config.json`, inside the agent `provider` config | `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max` | Sets the reasoning-effort override for that agent. |
| Agent priority routing | Gateway-selected `<agent-id>/agent_config.json`, inside the agent `provider` config | `true`, `false` | Enables priority/accelerated routing for that agent where supported. |
| Delete agent | Gateway-selected `<agent-id>/` | Dynamic non-default agents only | Deletes the custom agent directory. Static agents and `default_config` agents are protected. |

## Personalization settings

| Setting | Stored key | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Persona | `active_persona` in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` | Any persona with media, plus built-in fallbacks `tura`, `wonderful`, `pidan` | Selects the persona used by the workspace and avatar preview. |
| Avatar display | `agent_avatar.display_mode` encoded in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` key `agent_avatar` | `hidden`, `static`, `dynamic` | Hides the avatar, shows a static avatar, or enables dynamic/interactive avatar rendering. |
| Avatar pixel size | `agent_avatar.pixel_size` encoded in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` key `agent_avatar` | `10` through `30` | Controls avatar pixel-art block size. |
| Avatar threshold | `agent_avatar.threshold` encoded in `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` key `agent_avatar` | `100` through `200` | Controls the grayscale cutoff used when rendering avatar pixels. |

## Workspace config keys used by GUI

The GUI writes these keys to `<workspace>/.tura/config.conf` when runtime or personalization settings are saved:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `language` | Workspace language. |
| `model` | Selected model or tier. |
| `active_provider` | Provider part of a concrete model pair. |
| `active_model` | Model part of a concrete model pair. |
| `active_agent` | Selected default agent. |
| `active_persona` | Selected persona. |
| `model_variant` | Reasoning-effort variant. |
| `model_acceleration_enabled` | Priority routing flag. |
| `agent_avatar` | JSON-encoded avatar display, pixel size, threshold, and persona metadata. |
